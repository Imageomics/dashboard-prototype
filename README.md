# Dashboard Prototype
Prototype data dashboard using the [Cuthill Gold Standard Dataset](https://datacommons.tdai.osu.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.5072/FK2/GZYWNV&version=DRAFT), which was processed from Cuthill, et. al. (original dataset available at doi:10.5061/dryad.2hp1978).


### How it works

Install the required packages in a new environment, activate it, and run `python prototype_multiplot.py`. Then navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8050/` in your browser to see the graphs.

**Note:** `prototype_histogram.py` can be run in the same manner, but will only produce a histogram.
